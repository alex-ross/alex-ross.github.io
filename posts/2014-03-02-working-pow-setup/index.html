But when I'm working on multiply projects within same day it's really handy to have pow installed.</p><p><em>Hey wait, what is pow?</em> Pow is according to there own website "a zero-config Rack server for Mac OS X". But it's still needs some configuration... It's really great when working on multiply rack applications. It will boot up the apps you visit in the browser and have support for subdomains so you don't have to mix with your DNS or hosts file. You can read more about pow on there website at <a href="http://pow.cx/">pow.cx</a>.</p><p>In my case the zero-config part did not apply. Whitout any configurations this is what I see. <img src="/images/posts/2014-03-02/bundler-setup.png" alt="LoadError: cannot load such file -- bundler/setup"/></p><p>Pow has a good <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/pow/wiki/Troubleshooting#rbenv">troubleshooting</a> with lots of examples for similar problems.</p><p>Because I'm using both ZSH and Rbenv I listen to there advise and put this content in my <code>~/.powconfig</code>.</p><pre data-language="bash"><code><span class="hljs-built_in">export</span> HOME=/Users/ross
<span class="hljs-built_in">export</span> PATH=<span class="hljs-string">"/usr/local/opt/rbenv/shims:/usr/local/opt/rbenv/bin:<span class="hljs-variable">$PATH</span>"</span>
</code></pre><p>Sadly I still have the exact same result as before.</p><p>I'm also adding <code>eval "$(rbenv init -)"</code> at the bottom of the file which I read in a issue they linked to in the troubleshooting. Now it tells me that I haven't installed the correct ruby version used for this project which I know I have installed.</p><img src="/images/posts/2014-03-02/wrong-ruby-version.png" alt="Error: rbenv: version <code>1.9.3-p327' is not installed</code>"/><p>From here I could guess that it's not finding the correct path to my rbenv. When I run <code>echo $(rbenv root)</code> in my terminal and found out that my root path is</p><p><code>/usr/local/var/rbenv</code>. I'm also know that rbenv uses <code>RBENV_ROOT</code> and `echo $RBENV_ROOT` gives the same path in return. So my problem may be that I have multiply versions of rbenv installed. Next step will be to tell pow to use the same version I'm using in my terminal. Just changing the PATH from</p><p><code>/usr/local/opt/rbenv</code> to <code>/usr/local/var/rbenv</code> didn't work but when I also set</p><p><code>RBENV_ROOT</code> to <code>/usr/local/var/rbenv</code> it did. Yey!!!</p><h2>My <code>~/.powconfig</code> file</h2><pre data-language="bash"><code><span class="hljs-built_in">export</span> HOME=/Users/ross
