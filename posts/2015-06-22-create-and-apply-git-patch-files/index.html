</code></pre><h2>Now you are ready to create your patch file</h2><p>To create the patch file use this</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>git format-patch master --stdout &gt; choose-color.patch
</code></pre><p>This will now create a file in the same directory called <code>choose-color.patch</code>. If you skip the <code>--stdout &gt; choose-color.patch</code>-part you will get one patch file per commit. That may work fine in this example because we have only one commit. Feel free to add another commit just to see what the difference will be if you skip that part.</p><p>Let's now again pretend that you are transferring this file to me over an USB-stick or another awesome method.</p><h2>I will now test the patch file and apply it</h2><p>(Checkout master using <code>git checkout master</code> just because I guess you are doing my part to.)</p><p>Before we apply the patch I like to check the diffstat which is kind of a summary of what the patch will do.</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>git apply --<span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span> choose-color.patch

 chapter-1.md |    2 +-

</code></pre><p>If I get no output I'm good to go. Lets apply this patch!</p><p>When applying the patch I will actually <strong>not</strong> use <code>git apply choose-color.patch</code>. If I do, I will only apply the changes to my git index but I will not obtain any commit messages. Instead I will use <code>git am</code> and I will also use the <code>--signoff</code> option so that other people can see in the history (using <code>git log</code>) that I was the one approving this changes.</p><pre data-language="bash"><code>git am --signoff &lt; choose-color.patch
